# tomato
A simple implementation of a pomodoro app for the status bar in tmux.

Note that the data is by default saved in your Dropbox folder. This allows for
your data to be measured on all your machines. This can easily be changed to
suit your needs by editing the functions `data_file_path()` and `shelf_path()`
in `tomato.py`.

To see how to add the output to the status bar, see my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/sw561/RC_files).
